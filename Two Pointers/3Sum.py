"""
Extended version of Two Sum II

Given an array, return the triplets that sum up to zero. No duplicate triplets allowed

Hint : Break down the problem to Two Sum
-> to break it down to 2 sum -> sort()

a + b + c = 0

2 loops, external loop for the element a
inner while loop for two sum -> for b and c (left and right pointers) same  concept as two sum

inside this loop -> in the end -> need to increment left pointer (no need to increment right)
